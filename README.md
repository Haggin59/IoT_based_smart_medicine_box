Though the health care society is slow in adopting IoT (Internet of Things) than other
fields, IoT in the field of medicine is destined to keep the people safe and healthy where
the main purpose is to decrease the cost of health care in the coming years. In todayâ€™s
world, major problems related to healthcare and medicine are due to the lack of proper
medication and proper monitoring in the required time.This includes not consuming
medicines on time and not receiving proper medical checkups on time.The proposed
solution is a device which alerts the patient to consume prescribed medicines on time and
also monitors basic physiological parameters.where a medical professional or authorized
individual may continually check the patient's status on the cloud server. The sensors used
are pulse rate sensor, body temperature sensor (LM35), and the last one is a heartbeat
sensor. The signals from these sensors are sent to the micro-controller. The data are stored
and published online. Hence, the professional and family member can monitor their patient
from a remote location at any time
